		<h1>Camelids</h1>
		<p>
			The four llamas and two camels are camelids tend to be large and are strictly
			herbivorous. Camelids differ from ruminants in several ways. They have a three-
			chambered rather than a four-chambered digestive tract; an upper lip that is split in
			two with each part separately mobile; and an isolated incisor in the upper jaw. They
			have long legs that, because they lack tensor skin to bridge between thigh and body,
			look longer still. (from Wikipedia)
